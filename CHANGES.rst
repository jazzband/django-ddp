Change Log
==========

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.  
This project adheres to `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`_.

0.19.1 (2016-01-28)
-------------------
* Consistent handling of client errors (`MeteorError`) which shouldn't 
  be logged.
* Reduce wheel size from 204KB to 68KB by removing dddp.test package.
* Reduce sdist size from 10MB to 209KB by removing Meteor build from 
  test suite.
* Improve test suite with coverage now 65% when tested via Travis CI.
* Dropped support for Python 3.3.
* Fix for #3 -- drop support for Django 1.7, add support for Django 1.9 
  - thanks @schinckel.
* Re-raise exceptions from DDP WebSocket handlers rather than swallowing 
  them.
* Fix for #33 -- Add `meteor_autoupdate_clientVersions` publication.


0.19.0 (2015-12-16)
-------------------
* Dropped support for Django 1.7 (support expired on December 1 2015, 
  see https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions).
* Require `setuptools>=18.5` at install time due to use of
  `python_platform_implementation` environment marker.
* Moved repository to https://github.com/django-ddp/django-ddp (new
  Github organisation).
* Started work on documentation refresh.
* Fail on start if any child threads can't start (eg: port in use).
* Rudimentary support for dynamic publications which may now refer to `this.user`.
* Correctly close DB connections during shutdown, useful for test suite.
* Add missing versions and dates to the change log, and note on Semantic 
  Versioning.
* Emit `django.core.signals.request_finished` to close DB connection and 
  yield to other greenlets between processing messages from WebSocket.
* Back to universal wheels, thanks to PEP-0496 environment markers.
* Expand test suite coverage to start a DDP server instance and perform
  a HTTP GET request, no WebSocket/DDP tests yet.  Fails in Pyton 3
  because of a bug in `gevent-websocket`
  (https://bitbucket.org/noppo/gevent-websocket/issues/54/python-3-support).
* Fix for #23 (Python 3 compatibility).
* Set `application_name` on PostgreSQL async connection.
* Send `django.core.signals.request_finished` when closing WebSocket.
* Don't require `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` to import API.
* Tox test suite updated to runs against Python 2.7/3.3/3.4/3.5 and
  Django 1.8/1.9.
* Build wheels from tox environment to ensure consistency.
* Remove `debug` argment from `PostgresGreenlet` class (unused).

0.18.1 (2015-11-06)
-------------------
* Don't assume Django projects include a `wsgi.py`.

0.18.0 (2015-11-05)
-------------------
* Python implementation specific builds using tox so that Python2 and 
  Python3 can have different dependencies (eg: gevent>=1.1 for Pyton3).
* Added support for `METEOR_SETTINGS` environment variable.

0.17.3 (2015-10-30)
-------------------
* Depend on gevent>=1.1b6 if running anything other than CPython 2.7, 
  otherwise allow gevent 1.0 (current stable).
* Preliminary (but broken) support for PyPy/Jython/IronPython though 
  platform specific install_requires on psycopg2cffi instead of psycopg2 
  for all platforms except CPython 2/3.

0.17.2 (2015-10-29)
-------------------
* Python 3 fixes using `six` compatibility library (#16, #17).

0.17.1 (2015-10-14)
-------------------
* Fix minor issue where some subscription queries still used slow queries.

0.17.0 (2015-10-14)
-------------------
* Make the SQL for subscriptions much faster for PostgreSQL.
* Repeatable builds using ye olde make.
* Use tox test runner - no tests yet (#11).
* Add concrete requirement files for test suite (#11).
* Started documentation using Sphinx (#10).
* Python 3 style exception handling.

0.16.0 (2015-10-13)
-------------------
* New setting: `DDP_API_ENDPOINT_DECORATORS`.
    This setting takes a list of dotted import paths to decorators which are applied to API endpoints.  For example, enable New Relic instrumentation by adding the line below to your Django `settings.py`:

  .. code:: python

    DDP_API_ENDPOINT_DECORATORS = ['newrelic.agent.background_task']

* Fixed #7 -- Warn if using DB engines other than psycopg2 - thanks @Matvey-Kuk.
* Improvements to error/exception handling.
* Warn if many TX chunks are queued in case WebSocket has stalled.
* Bugfix thread locals setup when opening WebSocket.
* Add missing import for print function (Python 2).
* Work towards #16 -- Use `psycopg2cffi` compatibility if `psycopg2` not 
  installed.

0.15.0 (2015-09-25)
-------------------
* Renamed `Logs` collection and publication to `dddp.logs` to be consistent with naming conventions used elsewhere.
* Pass all attributes from `logging.LogRecord` via `dddp.logs` collection.
* Use select_related() and resultant cached relational fields to speed up Colleciton.serialize() by significantly reducing round-trips to the database.
* Fix bug in `get_meteor_ids()` which caused many extra database hits.

0.14.0 (2015-09-22)
-------------------
* Correctly handle serving app content from the root path of a domain.
* Account security tokens are now calculated for each minute allowing for finer grained token expiry.
* Fix bug in error handling where invalid arguments were being passed to `logging.error()`.
* Change setting names (and implied meanings):
    - DDP_PASSWORD_RESET_DAYS_VALID becomes 
      DDP_PASSWORD_RESET_MINUTES_VALID.
    - DDP_LOGIN_RESUME_DAYS_VALID becomes DDP_LOGIN_RESUME_MINUTES_VALID.
* Include `created` field in logs collection.
* Stop depending on `Referrer` HTTP header which is optional.
* Honour `--verbosity` in `dddp` command, now showing API endpoints in more verbose modes.
* Updated `dddp.test` to Meteor 1.2 and also showing example of URL config to serve Meteor files from Python.

0.13.0 (2015-09-18)
-------------------
* Abstract DDPLauncher out from dddp.main.serve to permit use from other contexts.
* Allow Ctrl-C (Break) handling at any time.
* Only run async DB connection when PostgresGreenlet is running.

* Use sane default options for `python setup.py bdist_wheel`.
* Fixed README link to meteor - thanks @LegoStormtroopr.

0.12.2 (2015-08-27)
-------------------
* Set blank=True on AleaIdField, allowing adding items without inventing 
  IDs yourself.

0.12.1 (2015-08-13)
-------------------
* Add `AleaIdMixin` which provides `aid = AleaIdField(unique=True)` to 
  models.
* Use `AleaIdField(unique=True)` wherever possible when translating 
  between Meteor style identifiers and Django primary keys, reducing 
  round trips to the database and hence drastically improving 
  performance when such fields are available.

0.12.0 (2015-08-11)
-------------------
* Get path to `star.json` from view config (defined in your urls.py) 
  instead of from settings.
* Dropped `dddp.server.views`, use `dddp.views` instead.

0.11.0 (2015-08-10)
-------------------

  serialization.

0.9.0 (2015-06-14)
------------------
* Added Django 1.8 compatibility.  The current implementation has a
  hackish (but functional) implementation to use PostgreSQL's
  `array_agg` function.  Pull requests are welcome.
* Retained compatibility with Django 1.7, though we still depend on the

0.7.0 (2015-05-28)
------------------
* Refactor serialization to improve performance through reduced number
  of database queries, especially on sub/unsub.

  API calls.

0.4.0 (2015-04-28)
------------------
* Make live updates honour user_rel restrictions, also allow superusers
  to see everything.
* Support serializing objects that are saved with F expressions by
  reading field values for F expressions from database explicitly before
  serializing.
* Allow `fresh` connections from browsers that have not established a
  session in the database yet, also allow subscriptions from
  unauthenticated sessions (but don't show any data for collections that
  have user_rel items defined).  This change includes a schema change,
  remember to run migrations after updating.

* Force creation of Alea/Meteor ID even if nobody seems to care -- they 
  do care if they're using the ID with latency compensated views.
* Support collections to models having non-integer primary key fields.
* Fix latency compensated Alea/Meteor ID generation to match Meteor 
  semantics of using a namespace to generate seeded Alea PRNGs.
